1. Why do we need to `import React from "react"` in our files?
React is what defines JSX.whithout it our jsx would not be working 

2. If I were to console.log(page) in index.js, what would show up?
A JavaScript object. React elements that describe what React should
eventually add to the real DOM for us.

3. What's wrong with this code:
```
const page = (
    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>This is my website!</p>
)
```
We need our JSX to be nested under a single parent element.an empty tag or fragment(<></>)
would also work

4. What does it mean for something to be "declarative" instead of "imperative"?
Declarative means I can tell the computer WHAT to do 
and expect it to handle the details. Imperative means I need
to tell it HOW to do each step.
declarative means telling to do something
imperative means telling each steps detail by detail

5. What does it mean for something to be "composable"?
We have small pieces that we can put together to make something
larger/greater than the individual pieces.

Quiz!

6. What is a React component?
A function that returns React elements. (UI)

7. What's wrong with this code?

    )

//name of function should be in pascal Case
function MyComponent (){}

8. What's wrong with this code?

function Header() {
    return (
        <header>
            <nav>
                <img src="./react-logo.png" width="40px" />
            </nav>

```
9. Challenge
/**
Challenge: Project setup

- Create a `components` folder
- Create the following components in separate files inside
  the components folder.  In each one, just render an `h1` 
  with the name of the component (e.g. return <h1>Navbar goes here</h1>):
    - Navbar
    - Main
- Create an App component outside the components folder (sibling to
  the index.js file)
    - Have App render the Navbar and Main components
- Import and render the App component inside of index.js using ReactDOM
    - At this point you should have your "Navbar goes here" etc. showing up
      in the mini-browser.
- Go to Google fonts and get the "Inter" font with weights 400, 600, and 700.
  Put the links to those fonts ABOVE the style.css link in index.html (Use
  the `<link/>` elements instead of the @import or npm options for getting
  the fonts. You may need to do some extra research to figure out how this 
  works if you haven't done it before)
